-- ==============================================================================
-- FIX RECURSION V2: AGGRESSIVE CLEANUP
-- ==============================================================================

-- 1. Drop ALL potential conflicting policies on 'profiles'
-- We try to guess common names used in previous versions
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Super Admins can view all profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Super Admins can update any profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public profiles are viewable by everyone" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable read access for all users" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable insert for authenticated users only" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable update for users based on email" ON profiles;

-- 2. Drop policies on 'team_members' just in case of cross-table recursion
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "View team members" ON team_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Manage team members" ON team_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable read access for internal users" ON team_members;

-- 3. Hardened Security Function
-- We set search_path to public to prevent any hijacking
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.check_is_super_admin()
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Direct check avoiding RLS entanglement
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles 
    WHERE id = auth.uid() 
    AND is_super_admin = true
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER SET search_path = public;

-- 4. Re-apply Clean Policies on PROFILES

-- Allow users to view their own profile OR if they are super admin
CREATE POLICY "Profiles viewable by users or admins" ON profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (
    auth.uid() = id OR check_is_super_admin() = true
  );

-- Allow users to update their own profile OR if they are super admin
CREATE POLICY "Profiles updatable by users or admins" ON profiles
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    auth.uid() = id OR check_is_super_admin() = true
  );

-- Allow users to insert their own profile (standard for auth)
CREATE POLICY "Profiles insertable by self" ON profiles
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    auth.uid() = id
  );

-- 5. Re-apply Clean Policies on TEAM_MEMBERS
CREATE POLICY "View team members" ON team_members
  FOR SELECT USING (
    owner_id = auth.uid() OR user_id = auth.uid() OR check_is_super_admin() = true
  );

CREATE POLICY "Manage team members" ON team_members
  FOR ALL USING (
    owner_id = auth.uid() OR check_is_super_admin() = true
  );
